//constants and variables
//explanation

//constants can be used to create variables but the difference between constantas and variables is that constants can not be changed
//forexample when given a value of 5, it while ahve to continue as 5 through out the
//code

//while variables

//variables can be used to name something forexample
var name = "shantal";
//the above is a variable and the difference between a constant and a variable is that 
//a variable can be changed unlike a constant.
